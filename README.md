# odin-recipes
This project is a website containing a few easy-to-make Japanese recipes. It should be noted that this website was created completely from scratch. The website is designed to have a front page which showcases three different recipes, and then links those recipes to their corresponding pages (which I also created). I utulized different skills, including but not limited to: Writing code in HTML, usage of git, setting up boilerplates, implementing images/links, using appropriate headings, and creating ordered/unordered lists for the recipes. This project made me realize how much I have already learned and got me excited for how much I am to advance going forward.
