        <p>Although once common in British and American cookbooks, it is now most common in Japan, where it can be found in most restaurants and convenience stores. A great way to serve it is with frozen whipped cream and chocolate sauce, although it's also delicious with ice cream, regular whipped cream, or flavored coffee cream. It can be served solid in glasses or cubed in bowls.</p>
